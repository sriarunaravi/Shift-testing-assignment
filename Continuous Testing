Continuous Testing is the process of executing automated tests throughout the software development lifecycle to get fast feedback on business risks and software quality.
Features:
Integrated with CI/CD pipelines

Runs tests automatically after every code change

Covers unit, integration, system, regression, and performance tests
Benefits:

Early defect detection

Faster releases

Better software quality

Reduced manual testing effort
Example:
When a developer commits code, automated tests run immediately. If a test fails, the build is stopped, and the issue is fixed before moving further.
CONCLUSION:
Continuous Testing ensures the application is always test-ready and release-ready.
